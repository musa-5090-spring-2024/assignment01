/*

    Hint 1: when you cast a TIMESTAMP to a DATE the time component of the value is simply stripped off

    Hint 2: Years, quarters, and other parts of DATEs or TIMESTAMPs can be retrieved from a TIMESTAMP using the
    [EXTRACT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT)
    function.
