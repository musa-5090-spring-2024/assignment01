/*
    Using the station status dataset, find the distance in meters of each
    station from Meyerson Hall. Use latitude 39.952415 and longitude -75.192584
    as the coordinates for Meyerson Hall.

    Your results should have three columns: station_id, station_geog, and
    distance. Round to the nearest fifty meters.

select
    id as station_id,
    geog as station_geog,
    floor(round(cast(st_distance(cast(st_geomfromtext('POINT(-75.192584 39.952415)', 4326) as geography), geog) as numeric) / 50, 0)) * 50 as distance
from
    indego.station_statuses
order by distance desc;


-- notes to self:
--	1) st_distance returns coordinate distance if given geometries
--	and meters if given geographies;
--	2) round to nearest n (where n <> 10) requires floor (x/n)*n rather than ROUND()
